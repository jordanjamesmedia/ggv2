    content: `Regular gutter maintenance is crucial for protecting your home from water damage. Here's everything you need to know about keeping your gutters in top condition.

## Why Gutter Maintenance Matters

Your gutters play a vital role in protecting your home's foundation, walls, and landscaping from water damage. When properly maintained, they direct rainwater away from your home, preventing:

- Foundation damage
- Basement flooding
- Soil erosion
- Siding damage
- Roof damage

## Maintenance Schedule

For optimal performance, follow this maintenance schedule:

1. Clean gutters at least twice a year
2. Inspect gutters after major storms
3. Check for proper alignment and secure fasteners quarterly
4. Test downspouts for proper drainage seasonally

## Professional vs. DIY Maintenance

While some homeowners choose to maintain their gutters themselves, professional service offers several advantages:

- Safety (no ladder accidents)
- Thorough inspection
- Professional equipment
- Time savings
- Warranty protection`,
